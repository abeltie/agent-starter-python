# AGENTS.md

This is a LiveKit Agents project (with LiveKit Agents for Python).

## Documentation

Always refer to the latest LiveKit Agents documentation when working with this project, available via the livekit-docs MCP server (if a server named livekit-docs is not already installed, it can be added with HTTP transport at http://localhost:5502/mcp/)

## Testing

When possible, add tests for agent behavior. Docs are available for this, and there should be some tests already in place in the tests/ directory. 

Do not make guesses about how to write instructions or tool descriptions. Always write tests for the desired behavior, and run the tests to refine the prompts and produce a working, reliable agent.
